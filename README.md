What Should I Do With All These Apples
======================================

List lives in apples.txt.

Text and URL are separated by two semi-colons (;;)

Page loads an item at random, and then as you advance, it takes you through the list sequentially.

Code still includes original site's Google Analytics ID, and possibly some other old janky bits.
